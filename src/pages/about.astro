    <p class="my-2">
      SmartDesk Robotics is a personal project created by Andres Pulido, born
      from a simple yet powerful idea: to build a smart assistant that helps
      manage daily work tasks and supports life at home. What started as a
      personal need quickly grew into a passionate vision for the future of
      human-robot interaction.

    <h2 class="text-2xl my-4">🌟 Our Mission</h2>

    <p class="my-2">
      To design and develop accessible, intelligent desktop robots that enhance
      productivity, bring joy to daily routines, and seamlessly integrate into
      our digital lives.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl my-4">👁️ Our Vision</h2>

    <p class="my-2">
      We envision a world where smart assistants are not just tools, but
      companions—creative, intuitive, and deeply personal. Our goal is to place
      an adaptable and friendly robot on every desk and in every home,
      empowering people through meaningful technology.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl my-4">🔬 Future Projects</h2>

    <p class="my-2">
      We are currently working on expanding Edison—our flagship desktop
      robot—with new modular capabilities, including:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Customizable voice recognition</li>
      <li>Integration with smart home systems</li>
      <li>AI-driven productivity analysis</li>
      <li>Developer-friendly APIs for personal extensions</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="my-2">
      In addition, we’re exploring the development of new smart hardware such as
      MIDI controllers and interactive interfaces for creators and musicians.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl my-4">🌍 Why It Matters</h2>

    <p class="my-2">
      In an age of increasing complexity and digital overload, tools that help
      us stay focused, organized, and connected are more important than ever.
      SmartDesk Robotics combines innovation and practicality, giving people an
      assistant that understands their workflow, habits, and needs.
    </p>

    <p class="my-2">
      Whether you’re working from home, managing a creative studio, or just need
      a reliable sidekick to remind you of your meetings, Edison is here to make
      your life easier—and a little more fun.
